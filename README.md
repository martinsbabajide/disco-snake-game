# disco-snake-game
Popular snake game of the early 90s, the aim of the game is to get points while eating the fruit and the "more you eat, the more you grow", which makes it harder as you progress.

I used java as my programming language with the eclipse IDE to bring this 90's game to life, i changed the UI of the game to make it more disco like, added the restart and level of difficulty options 

The score of the game is generated real-time and the final score is displayed on the top of the screen after a user loses or pauses the game

For test automation, to improve the functionality of the game, i applied the JUnit testing.
